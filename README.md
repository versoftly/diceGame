This code implements the dice game with the following features:

Starting Player Determination: The players roll the dice once at the beginning. The player with the higher roll starts.
Turn-Based Gameplay: Players take turns selecting a number from 1 to 6.
Dice Roll: On each turn, the player rolls the dice.
Score Calculation:
If the player guesses the dice roll correctly, the dice number is added to their score.
If the player guesses incorrectly, the dice number is added to the opponent's score.
Option Removal: After each turn, the selected number is removed from the available options.
Game Over: The game ends when only two options remain. The player with the higher score wins.
User Interface: Includes a clear and user-friendly UI with player scores, dice image, option buttons, and turn indicator.
Animations: The dice image changes dynamically with each roll, providing visual feedback.
Remember to:

Save the dice images (dice1.png to dice6.png) in the same directory as the HTML file.
Open the HTML file in a web browser to play the game.
